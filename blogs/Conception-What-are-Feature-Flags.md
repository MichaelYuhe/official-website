title: 'What is Feature Flags'
description: "Feature flags is a modern engineering technology that decouples code deployments from feature releases, giving you control over which end-users see which features. With feature flags, you can progressively release or roll back individual features to or from a specific group of users without redeployment. You can toggle a feature on and off to subsets of users."

## What are Feature Flags?

Feature flags are a software development technique that allows developers to toggle on and off features without changing the codebase. They are also known as feature toggles or feature switches. This means that developers can release a feature to select users or test environments before releasing it to the general public. An added benefit is the ability to turn off a feature immediately if it is causing issues in production. Feature flags provide a way for teams to practice continuous delivery by releasing features incrementally and safely.

Feature management is the practice of using feature flags in conjunction with other tools to manage the release process. With feature management, teams can target specific user segments, schedule feature releases, and track feature usage. It allows teams to gain more control over the release process and reduce the risk of a failed release. Feature flags and management can benefit software development teams by providing more control over the release process, allowing them to release features faster and safer, and reducing the risk of releasing buggy software. It’s an essential aspect of DevOps and continuous delivery.

## Who and When to Use Feature Flags?-

### Target Audience for Feature Flags

The target audience for feature flags predominantly includes software development teams, product managers, and QA testing teams. Feature flags can be used by startups and large-scale organizations alike. Teams that need to test new features or run A/B tests can benefit from using feature flags. Furthermore, teams that want to gradually release new features or switch off a feature quickly in the event that it's causing performance issues can use feature flags. By using feature flags, teams can experiment, test, and iterate on their software products, reducing risk and faster time-to-market. They can also help respond to customer feedback while also minimizing the likelihood of introducing new bugs.

### Use Cases for Feature Flags

Feature flags are very useful during software development as they can help in controlling and managing features. They can be used in several scenarios, including A/B testing where two versions of a feature are compared to determine which one is better. Feature flags can also be used in progressive rollouts where new features are gradually released to users to assess their impact on the system's performance. Additionally, feature flags can be used in emergency scenarios where an urgent fix is required, and the release of a new feature has to be halted. Overall, feature flags can help developers in improving their software development process, reducing bugs, and increasing customer satisfaction.

## What is Feature Management?

Feature management is a new class of software development tools and techniques rooted in feature flags. It provides a holistic framework for feature flag-driven development, A/B testing, and experimentation, enabling teams to use flags on a massive scale across a variety of use cases.

Feature management empowers all teams to deliver, control, experiment with, and monetize their software.

- Help product managers to improve user experience by fine-grained targeting for who sees what experiences and when, measuring the impact of features’ rollouts, and running A/B tests to improve feature quality.
- Enable Sales and Customer Success to close more deals with live demos and feature trials at the push of a button.
- Help Support debug exactly which features and tests a customer has for faster resolution.
- Give Marketing and Design the ability to fine-tune target audiences, coordinate announcements, and manage special customer programs.
- Empower finance teams quickly get the billing report of how customers used and paid for the different features and subscriptions.
